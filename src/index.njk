        This site is populated with content from a public <a href="https://trello.com/b/Zzc0USwZ/hellotrello">Trello board</a>. Every deployment pulls the  content from the Trello API and generates the site's HTML at build time on <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>.

        This example includes <a href="https://stage--hellotrello.netlify.app">staging</a> and <a href="https://hellotrello.netlify.app">production</a> environments. Go ahead, take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
        Environments are created by <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#branches-and-deploys">Netlify's Branch Deploy</a> feature, but the code on each branch is identical — they simply filter the content included based on the labels on the Trello cards and the branch name.
